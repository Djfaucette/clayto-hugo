The [East Coast Game Conference][ecgc] was a lot of fun! Jared and I gave a 6-hour hands-on workshop where led the audience through building a game with entirely open-source gamedev tools.

## Abstract

> Join us for a workshop on game jams and open-source game development tools.
>
> Open-source tools have been lovingly crafted that cover every medium of game development. Through a series of hands-on labs, we will introduce you to many of those tools, with a focus on using them for game jams.
