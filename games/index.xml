      <description>Play now!  Three years ago, surrounded by monitors in a dark, blue-hued room, a particular screen caught my eye. My girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s (now wife&amp;rsquo;s) eye was caught by the same screen, and we crossed the room to investigate.
We were visiting the Indie Game Revolution exhibit at EMP in Seattle, and what we found on that screen was Scene I, Act I of Kentucky Route Zero. It took me three years, but I finally rediscovered KR0 a few weeks ago.</description>

      <description>Play now!   Humanity, listen up. This is the Universe. I am sick of you sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong. That’s why there’s a huge asteroid heading straight for your pitiful Earth, courtesy of yours truly. I see you’ve built a flimsy Barrier and a stockpile of Missiles, but it won’t help. Enjoy the end times! Bye-bye. Talk soon.
– The Universe
  The weekend before Ludum Dare, I wrote a post about preparing for Ludum Dare 38.</description>
